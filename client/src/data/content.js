  {
    question: 'Can medication completely relieve tooth pain?',
    answer:
      'Not entirely. Medicines may give short-term relief, but long-term relief requires identifying and treating the root cause with professional dental care.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Does teeth scaling cause enamel damage, sensitivity, or gaps between teeth?',
    answer:
      'No. Scaling removes plaque and tartar safely. It does not damage enamel or create gaps. Temporary sensitivity may occur but usually settles as gums heal.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Can fluorosis stains be removed through scaling?',
    answer:
      'Scaling removes surface stains, not intrinsic fluorosis stains. Fluorosis may need bleaching, veneers, or crowns for cosmetic improvement.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Can painful teeth be treated with fillings?',
    answer:
      'Not always. If decay reaches the pulp, root canal treatment or extraction may be needed. Fillings help when damage is limited to enamel and dentin.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Is placing a cap or crown necessary after root canal treatment (RCT)?',
    answer:
      'Yes. A crown is usually recommended to protect the treated tooth, reduce fracture risk, and improve durability while chewing.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Can milk teeth need root canal treatment (RCT)?',
    answer:
      'Yes. If a milk tooth has a deep cavity and is expected to remain for some time, RCT can preserve it and avoid early loss.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How can I maintain good oral hygiene?',
    answer:
      'Brush twice daily with proper technique, rinse after meals, floss regularly, and schedule routine dental check-ups.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What is the best age to get braces?',
    answer:
      'Braces are often most effective between ages 12 and 14, but some cases may benefit from earlier intervention based on dental condition.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Do all wisdom teeth need to be removed?',
    answer:
      'No. Removal is needed only when wisdom teeth are impacted, infected, painful, or causing damage to nearby teeth.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Is it important to replace missing teeth after extraction?',
    answer:
      'Yes. Replacement helps preserve bite alignment and prevents shifting of nearby teeth, supporting chewing and oral function.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What are the benefits of dental implants?',
    answer:
      'Dental implants restore appearance and chewing function with a stable, natural-looking, long-term replacement option.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Which type of toothbrush and toothpaste should I use?',
    answer:
      'Use a soft or medium-bristled small-head toothbrush and non-abrasive fluoride toothpaste. Replace the brush every three months.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What causes tooth sensitivity?',
    answer:
      'Sensitivity can be due to enamel wear, decay, exposed roots, or hairline cracks in teeth.',

    answer: 'Visit your dentist every six months for check-ups, cleaning, and preventive care.',
